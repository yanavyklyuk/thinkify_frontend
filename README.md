# Thinkify admin page

Thinkify is a mobile app for a rehabilitation and development of cognitive skills for people who deserve it. It contains different games for cognitive skills training and events related to rehabilitation. However, certainly there must be a person, namely admin, who moderates all the information inside Thinkify app. Therefore, this repository contains a frontend part of website, which is called admin page.

# Labs

This repository contains lab1 and lab2. Lab3, lab4, lab5 is covered by softserve project. Backend is in other repository. It was written using FastAPI framework for creating REST API endpoints using Python language.

## Lab1

Lab1 is deployed on the GitHub Pages. It contains a static design of the pages. Also, for developing the design the Figma was used with a link:

https://www.figma.com/design/k3acWJMaIduXXSGolRNzCA/Thinkify-admin-page?node-id=0-1&t=l4mxKCw5mMg68a7H-1

HTML and CSS was used for creating static pages.

## Lab2

For Lab 2, pure JavaScript and AJAX were used. AJAX enabled communication with the backend API, allowing real data to be displayed and modified, which is ultimately saved to the database. Pure JavaScript was used to create dynamic pages in this single-page application (SPA).
